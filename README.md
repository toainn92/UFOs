# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana create a webpage that has dynamic tables to provide more in depth analysis of UFO sightings. The website will allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The filtered data includes the following:

- date
- city
- state
- country 
- shape

## Results
The main webpage shows all the UFO sighting data onto an unfiltered table. The data is shown below:

On the bottom left corner of the webpage, there is a filter where a user can filter based on date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO sighting. The picture below shows the filter search bar.

By clicking "UFO Sightings" at the top left corner, the table and filters can be reset so a new data search can be completed.

## Summary

### Drawback
The one drawback of this webpage is that the data filter search bar is case-sensitive. For example, you have to type in the correct Country as "us" and not "US".

### Recommendations:
- To further develop the webpage, a possible update is to create a box to clear out the filters instead of clicking on the link on the top left corner.

- Another development is to include a date range instead of static time. This is so the user can filter by time period for UFO sightings.
