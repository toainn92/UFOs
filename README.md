## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana create a webpage that has dynamic tables to provide more in depth analysis of UFO sightings. The website will allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The filtered data includes the following:

- date
- city
- state
- country 
- shape

## Results
The main webpage shows all the UFO sighting data onto an unfiltered table. The data is shown below:
